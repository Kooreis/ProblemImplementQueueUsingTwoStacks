# Question: How can you implement a queue using two stacks? C# Summary

The provided C# code implements a queue using two stacks, which is a common data structure problem. The class `QueueUsingStacks` is defined with two private stack variables, `stack1` and `stack2`. The `Enqueue` method, which is used to add an item to the queue, simply pushes the item onto `stack1`. The `Dequeue` method, which is used to remove an item from the queue, checks if `stack2` is empty. If it is, it pops all items from `stack1` and pushes them onto `stack2`, effectively reversing the order of the items. It then pops and returns the top item from `stack2`, which is the first item that was added to the queue. The `Peek` method works similarly to `Dequeue`, but instead of removing the item from the queue, it simply returns the first item. If `stack2` is empty, it transfers all items from `stack1` to `stack2` before returning the top item. The `Main` method demonstrates the usage of this queue by enqueuing and dequeuing several items.

# Python Differences

The Python version of the solution follows the same logic as the C# version. Both versions use two stacks to implement a queue. The `enqueue` operation in Python is equivalent to the `Enqueue` method in C#, which pushes an item into the first stack. The `dequeue` operation in Python is equivalent to the `Dequeue` method in C#, which pops all items from the first stack and pushes them into the second stack if the second stack is empty, then pops the top item from the second stack.

However, there are some differences in the language features and methods used in the two versions:

1. Data Structures: In C#, the `Stack` class from the `System.Collections.Generic` namespace is used to create the stacks. In Python, the built-in list data type is used as a stack. The `append` method is equivalent to the `Push` method in C#, and the `pop` method is equivalent to the `Pop` method in C#.

2. Exception Handling: In the C# version, an `InvalidOperationException` is thrown when trying to dequeue or peek an empty queue. The Python version does not have this error handling. Instead, it checks if both stacks are empty before trying to dequeue an item, and prints a message if the queue is empty.

3. User Interaction: The Python version includes a user interface that allows the user to choose to enqueue or dequeue items or quit the program. The C# version does not have this feature; it simply enqueues and dequeues items in the `Main` method.

4. Function Definitions: In C#, methods are defined inside a class using the `public` keyword. In Python, methods are defined inside a class without any access modifier. The `def` keyword is used to define a function or method in Python.

5. Main Function: In C#, the `Main` method is the entry point of the program. In Python, the `main` function is defined and then called in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block. This block ensures that the `main` function is only executed when the script is run directly, not when it is imported as a module.

# Java Differences

The Java version of the solution differs from the C# version in the way it handles the `enqueue` operation. In the C# version, the `enqueue` operation simply pushes the new item onto `stack1`. However, in the Java version, before pushing the new item onto `stack1`, it first moves all existing items from `stack1` to `stack2`, then pushes the new item onto `stack1`, and finally moves all items back from `stack2` to `stack1`. This ensures that the oldest item is always on top of `stack1`, which is then directly accessible for the `dequeue` operation.

In the C# version, the `dequeue` operation checks if `stack2` is empty and if so, it moves all items from `stack1` to `stack2` before popping the top item from `stack2`. This is not necessary in the Java version because of the way the `enqueue` operation is implemented.

The `peek` operation is not implemented in the Java version.

In terms of language features, both versions use similar features from their respective languages. They both use generic Stack classes (`Stack<int>` in C# and `Stack<Integer>` in Java) and they both have methods for pushing, popping, and checking if a stack is empty. The C# version uses the `Count` property to check if a stack is empty, while the Java version uses the `isEmpty()` method. The C# version throws an `InvalidOperationException` when trying to dequeue from an empty queue, while the Java version prints an error message and terminates the program using `System.exit(0)`.
